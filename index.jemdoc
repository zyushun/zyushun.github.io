== About me
I'm a Ph.D student in School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China. I'm very proud to be advised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo].  I’m also very fortunate to work closely with [https://ruoyus.github.io Prof. Ruoyu Sun (UIUC)]. 
Previously, I did my undergraduate study in the Department of Mathematics at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech). 
 My research focuses on optimization and deep learning. My goal is to become a leading expert in my field in the next few years.
